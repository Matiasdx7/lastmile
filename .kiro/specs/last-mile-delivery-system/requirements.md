# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a last mile delivery application prototype similar to Onfleet for academic purposes. The system will manage the complete delivery workflow from order reception through customer delivery, including BPM diagram visualization, backend APIs, and web/mobile application interfaces.

The system will handle order management, load consolidation, vehicle assignment, route planning, dispatch operations, and delivery tracking to provide a comprehensive last mile logistics solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Order Reception and Management

**User Story:** As a logistics coordinator, I want to receive and manage incoming delivery orders, so that I can process them through the delivery pipeline efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new order is submitted THEN the system SHALL capture order details including customer information, delivery address, package details, and delivery preferences
2. WHEN an order is received THEN the system SHALL assign a unique order ID and timestamp
3. WHEN order details are incomplete THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and provide error messages
4. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL store it with status "pending" for further processing
5. IF an order contains special delivery instructions THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review

### Requirement 2: Load Consolidation

**User Story:** As a logistics coordinator, I want to consolidate multiple orders into optimized loads, so that I can maximize delivery efficiency and reduce transportation costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple orders share similar delivery areas THEN the system SHALL group them for potential consolidation
2. WHEN consolidating orders THEN the system SHALL consider package dimensions, weight limits, and delivery time windows
3. WHEN a consolidation is created THEN the system SHALL generate a consolidated load with combined order details
4. WHEN load capacity is exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent additional orders from being added and suggest alternative loads
5. IF orders have conflicting delivery requirements THEN the system SHALL flag them as incompatible for consolidation

### Requirement 3: Vehicle Assignment

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want to assign appropriate vehicles to consolidated loads, so that deliveries can be executed with suitable transportation resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a consolidated load is ready THEN the system SHALL display available vehicles with capacity and location information
2. WHEN assigning a vehicle THEN the system SHALL verify the vehicle capacity matches or exceeds the load requirements
3. WHEN a vehicle is assigned THEN the system SHALL update the vehicle status to "assigned" and link it to the load
4. WHEN no suitable vehicles are available THEN the system SHALL queue the load and notify fleet managers
5. IF a vehicle becomes unavailable after assignment THEN the system SHALL allow reassignment to alternative vehicles

### Requirement 4: Manual Route Planning

**User Story:** As a route planner, I want to manually create and optimize delivery routes, so that I can ensure efficient delivery sequences considering real-world constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a load is assigned to a vehicle THEN the system SHALL display all delivery addresses on a map interface
2. WHEN planning a route THEN the system SHALL allow drag-and-drop reordering of delivery stops
3. WHEN a route is modified THEN the system SHALL calculate estimated travel time and distance
4. WHEN route planning is complete THEN the system SHALL save the route sequence with the assigned load
5. IF delivery time windows conflict with route sequence THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicts and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN a route is finalized THEN the system SHALL generate turn-by-turn directions for the driver

### Requirement 5: Dispatch Operations

**User Story:** As a dispatch coordinator, I want to dispatch vehicles with their assigned routes, so that deliveries can begin execution according to the planned schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a route is ready for dispatch THEN the system SHALL display dispatch confirmation with route summary
2. WHEN dispatching a vehicle THEN the system SHALL update all associated orders to "in transit" status
3. WHEN dispatch is confirmed THEN the system SHALL send route information to the assigned driver's mobile device
4. WHEN a vehicle is dispatched THEN the system SHALL begin real-time tracking of the delivery progress
5. IF critical information changes after dispatch THEN the system SHALL notify the driver and update the route accordingly

### Requirement 6: Customer Delivery Execution

**User Story:** As a delivery driver, I want to execute deliveries according to the planned route, so that I can complete customer deliveries efficiently and provide delivery confirmations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN arriving at a delivery location THEN the system SHALL display customer and package information
2. WHEN a delivery is completed THEN the system SHALL allow capture of delivery confirmation (signature, photo, notes)
3. WHEN delivery confirmation is captured THEN the system SHALL update the order status to "delivered" with timestamp
4. WHEN a delivery cannot be completed THEN the system SHALL allow recording of failed delivery reasons and next steps
5. IF all deliveries on a route are completed THEN the system SHALL update the vehicle status to "available"
6. WHEN delivery status changes THEN the system SHALL send notifications to customers and logistics coordinators

### Requirement 7: BPM Diagram Visualization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view the business process flow through interactive diagrams, so that I can understand and optimize the delivery workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the BPM view THEN the system SHALL display a visual diagram showing all six main process steps
2. WHEN viewing the diagram THEN the system SHALL highlight the current status of active orders within the process flow
3. WHEN clicking on process nodes THEN the system SHALL show detailed information about that process stage
4. WHEN process bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL visually indicate delays or issues in the workflow
5. IF process metrics are available THEN the system SHALL display performance indicators for each process stage

### Requirement 8: Web and Mobile Application Interfaces

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to access the delivery system through both web and mobile interfaces, so that I can manage operations from different devices and locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive dashboard for desktop and tablet use
2. WHEN using the mobile application THEN the system SHALL provide optimized interfaces for drivers and field operations
3. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent data and user session state
4. WHEN offline connectivity occurs THEN the mobile application SHALL cache critical data and sync when connection is restored
5. IF user roles differ THEN the system SHALL display appropriate interface elements based on user permissions

### Requirement 9: Backend API and Data Management

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want robust APIs and data management, so that the system can integrate with external services and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external systems request data THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs with proper authentication
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and return appropriate error codes
3. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails and data consistency across all components
4. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without data corruption
5. IF data backup is required THEN the system SHALL provide export capabilities for all system data
